# Embed Video Instead (EVI)

## Purpose

Embed video instead of normal video on youtube, for... reasons.

It makes the videos a bit weird, there is some funky stuff, but it gets the job done.

But! This will probably stop working eventually

## How to install

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `brave://extensions/` if you're using brave, or `edge:` or `opera:` you get the idea go to the extensions page)
3. Enable developer mode (if you don't know how to do this, you can search it up)
4. Click on "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder where you cloned this repo
6. Go to youtube and enjoy

## Mozilla version? Safari?

By any means, you can fork this and do the necessary changes to make it work on other browsers, I just don't have the time to do it myself.
